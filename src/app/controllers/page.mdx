# Introduction

As the name goes **controllers**, these are array of elements in the builder right side bar, which are mapped to control the values of the props of your blocks. 

The number of controllers are set by you depending on the number of props you want to control or map to. A typical control is just an object which is added to the `sideEditingProps`  array of each block `Schema` object or used directly in your component using any of our `in page controller` components.

## In page prop editors / controllers
These are components imported from `visio-cms-lib` which are used to render the props of your block in the page.They allowing content creators to customize the block's content or mapped prop directly in the web page just like editing a doucument in Microsft word.

There are 4 main in page controllers which are:
- [Text](/in-page-text-controller)
- [RichTextEditor](/in-page-rich-text-editor-controller)
- [Image](/in-page-image-controller)
- [List](/in-page-list-controller)

## Side prop editors / controllers
These are objects which are added to the `sideEditingProps`  array of each block `Schema` object. They specify the props that content creators can modify using the Visio sidebar controllers.
