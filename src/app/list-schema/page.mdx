# List Schema
When a list is added to our block, we need to define / register the list in the side bar. This is done by adding a `lists` key to the block's schema object. The `lists` key is an array of List that define the schema and registers a list in the builder. Having done this, any time a list or list item is selected in the page, the list's controls will be displayed in the builder's sidebar under the `properties tab` which will give us the controls to `add`, `remove`, `move up` and `move down` the list items.

    ### Props

    <Properties>
      <Property name="propName" type="string">
        This represents the prop this controller is controlling.
      </Property>

      <Property name="label" type="string">
         This is the label which represents each list item in the builder's sidebar. eg. 'Feature', 'Item', 'Section' etc.
         Then the side bar will show 'Add Feature', 'Add Item', 'Add Section' etc.
      </Property>

      <Property name="defaultValue" type="string, array, object, boolean, number">
         This is the value appended to the list when the `add` button is clicked in the builder's sidebar.
      </Property>

      <Property name="sideEditingProps" type="SideEditingProps[]">
          This is a side editing prop or controller which controls the value of each list item.
      </Property>

       <Property name="subLists" type="ListSchema[]">
          If the list contains other list in it's `renderComponent function`, we consider it as a sublist, there for we need to define the schema and register it in the subLists array. A sublist can also contain sublists.
