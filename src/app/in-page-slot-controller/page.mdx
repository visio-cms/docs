# Slot
`Blocks` can also act as wrappers for other blocks, making them useful for building templates where content editors define the structure of it's conent. 
To achieve this, we use the `Slot` component within the `block`. The `Slot` serves as a container that holds an array of `Page blocks` and renders them in the order they are specified.
