# Deploying a Visio cms project
You can host a Visio website on almost any hosting environment. The starter projects with Next.js or Gatsby are configured to use Static Site Generation. Therefore, you just need a hosting environment capable of building the website and serving the generated static content. Examples include Netlify, Vercel or Digital ocean.
