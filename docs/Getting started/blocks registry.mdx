# Blocks registry

The blocks registry serves as a means to expose our blocks to the builder. It defines controls that dictate how the block's props can be manipulated through the builder sidebar, along with other attributes for identifying the block.


## Register your block

In our previous example, we built and exported a simple block from our `/components/blocks/` folder. Now let's register the block in our block_registry file
and define some attributes and controls for it.



```tsx title="/components/blocks_registry.tsx"

import { Block } from 'visio-cms';
import MyFirstBlock from '@/components/blocks/MyFirstBlock';
import { LayersIcon } from '@radix-ui/react-icons';

const registeredBlocks: BlockT<CustomControllerT>[] = [
  {
    component: MyFirstBlock,
    title: 'My First Block',
    icon: <LayersIcon />,
    defaultInputs: {
      title: 'This is my first title',
      subTitle:
        "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s",
        image: {}
    },
    controllers: [
      { name: 'title', type: 'text', label: 'Title' },
      { name: 'subTitle', type: 'richText', label: 'Sub Title' },
      { name: 'image', type: 'image', label: 'Side Image' },
    ],
    key: 'myFirstBlock',
  },
]

export default registeredBlocks
```


## Block object Key Meanings

Let's explore the `registeredBlocks` array and decipher the significance of each key in the object:


- **`component`** - Reference to the block you built and imported.
- **`title`** - Representation name of the block in the builder.
- **`icon`** - Icon to visually represent the block. For example, an `ImageIcon` from `@radix-ui/react-icons`. Choose any suitable icon (e.g., SVGs, FontAwesome icons, Luci-react icons).
- **`defaultInputs`** - Default prop values that come with the block when initially added. This object matches the props of your block. In our example, we have `title`, `subTitle` and `image`. We can also set it to an empty object and add a null check at where we reference it in the block just like what we did to the image. eg. `defaultInputs: {}`
- **`controllers`** - Array of controls managing the values of your props. Each prop is mapped to a controller, allowing non-coders to modify block attributes easily (e.g., color, image, font size). In our example, we map `title` to text controller, `subTitle` to a rich text editor and `image` to an image controller.
- **`key`** - Unique identifier for the block. **NB** Should not contain spaces and must be unique.

## Adding the blocks to the web page

We can start adding our block the a web page. Visit http://localhost:3000/builder/home. You have to login with your visio cms email and password.


For the first time opening the builder after login, you will be asked to create a page. Enter your page name and slug. **NB** `/home` is always your home page of your website.
In the builder page, we can click on the plus icon and select our block in the command modal. Also we can search for it.
