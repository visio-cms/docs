# Spacing controller

The spacing controller allows you to give your users the freedom to adjust the margin and padding of your blocks. This is handled internally by visio once the controller is added to your prefered block.

To do so, just add the below **controller** to your existing block registry

```jsx
    { type: 'spacing', label: 'Spacing', name: 'spacing', allowControls: ['margin', 'padding'] }
```



```jsx title="/components/blocks_registry.tsx"

import HeroBlock from '@/components/blocks/HeroBlock';

const registeredBlocks: BlockT<CustomControllerT>[] = [
 *****
  {
    component: HeroBlock
    ****
    controllers: [
      *****
      { type: 'spacing', label: 'Spacing', name: 'spacing', allowControls: ['margin', 'padding'] },
    ],
    ****
  },
]
```

The allowControls key takes an array of the type of spacing you would want your users to have control over. Here, we have both margin and padding. You can use either of them or all.

**Note** the name **spacing** from the controller by visio to approiately map the spacing to the style attributes of the block.
