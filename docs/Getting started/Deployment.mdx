# Deploying visio Website


## Hosting Requirements

You can host a Visio website on almost any hosting environment. The starter projects with Next.js or Gatsby are configured to use Static Site Generation. Therefore, you just need a hosting environment capable of building the website and serving the generated static content. Examples include Netlify, Vercel or Digital ocean. If you prefer Server-Side Rendering, ensure your hosting environment can generate pages at runtime, typically by running Node.js.

## Environment Variables

Visio relies on two crucial environment variables, which are stored locally in your `.env` file during development and must be set in the hosting provider's environment variables during deployment:

1. **PROJECT_ID**: This variable must be accessible by the browser and is used by the Admin interface.

2. **API_KEY**: This is the secret API_KEY that should not be exposed to the browser.

To expose the `PROJECT_ID` variable to the browser, use the following conventions:

- For Next.js, name it `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID`.
  
- For Gatsby, name it `GATSBY_PROJECT_ID`.

Remember to securely manage the `API_KEY` to prevent exposure to the client-side code.

Ensure these environment variables are appropriately configured in your hosting environment to ensure the smooth functioning of your Visio website.

Alternatively, you can built the project and upload the build files to any vps server of your choice
