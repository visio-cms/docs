# Installation

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18.0 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
> When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.



## Scafold a new visio project

To create a new visio app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-visio-app my-website
```
The installation step will ask of your api key. Get your [API key](https://visio-dashboard.vercel.app) here if you currently do not have it.

## Project Structure

If you've selected the classic template and named your site "my-website," the ensuing outcome will include the generation of the subsequent files within a newly created directory named "my-website/":

```
my-website
â”œâ”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 404
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [...page]

## Project Structure Rundown

- **`/404/page.tsx`** - Contains a 404 not found component from visio-cms. This page is shown to users when the page they are redirecting to does not exist. You can replace this page with your custom-built 404 page.

- **`[...page]/page.tsx`** - This is a public page that dynamically renders all the pages you build for users to visit. Example: [https://mywebsite.com/mypage](https://mywebsite.com/mypage)

- **`builder/`** - This is a protected page that contains the visio-builder UI.

- **`builder/[...page]/page.tsx`** - Renders the visio builder and can be opened with [https://mywebsite.com/builder/index](https://mywebsite.com/builder/index). "index" here can be the slug of the page you want to edit. **NB** you will be asked to log in to access this page. Use the email and password used in registering visiocms.com

- **`globals.css`** - Contains basic Tailwind CSS, which comes with visio. [Optional] Can be removed if you are not using Tailwind for your project.

- **`layout.css`** - This is the main layout that wraps your entire pages. Learn more about layouts [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts).

- **`page.tsx`** - Default Next.js initial page that comes with the installation of a Next.js project. [Can be deleted]

- **`components/`** - This folder should contain all global components you will use for your project.

- **`components/blocks/`** - This should contain all blocks you will build for your projects. Each block should have its file, for example, `MyFirstBlock.tsx`, and should be exported.

- **`components/blocks_registry.tsx`** - Your exported blocks from `components/blocks/` should be imported and registered here in this file. Learn more about how to register a block and set up controllers.

- **`middleware.ts`** - Contains a simple middleware that redirects users to [https://mywebsite.com/index](https://mywebsite.com/index) when they try visiting [https://mywebsite.com](https://mywebsite.com). "/index" should always be your home page.

- **`package.json`** - Contains your normal dependencies.

- **`/public`** - Contains all your static assets.

- **`/tailwind.config.ts`** - Contains tailwind configuration. Can be removed if you are not using Tailwind for your project.

- **`/tsconfig.json`** - TypeScript configuration for your project

# Running the project
To view your modifications in real-time as you edit the files, you can initiate a local development server. This server will host your website, allowing you to observe and apply the most recent changes.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs
    defaultValue="npm"
    values={[
        {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
        {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
        {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="npm">
```

```bash
cd my-website
npm run dev
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">
```

```bash
cd my-website
yarn run dev
```

```mdx-code-block

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pnpm">
```

```bash
cd my-website
pnpm dev
```

```mdx-code-block

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
